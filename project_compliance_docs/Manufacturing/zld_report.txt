ZERO LIQUID DISCHARGE (ZLD) TECHNICAL REPORT
Project: GreenTech Manufacturing ETP System

1. Design Basis:
   - Inlet Flow: 10 KLD (Maximum)
   - Operating Hours: 20 Hours/Day
   - Nature of Effluent: Oily wash water + Phospating sludge

2. Treatment Logic:
   Step 1: Collection Tank (Equalization)
   Step 2: Oil & Grease Trap (Skimmer)
   Step 3: Chemical Dosing (Lime + Alum) -> Flash Mixer
   Step 4: Tube Settler (Primary Clarification)
   Step 5: Aeration Tank (MBBR Media)
   Step 6: Secondary Clarifier
   Step 7: Pressure Sand Filter (PSF) + Activated Carbon Filter (ACF)
   Step 8: Reverse Osmosis (RO) Plant
   Step 9: Multiple Effect Evaporator (MEE) for RO Rejects

3. Expected Output Quality (Permeate):
   - pH: 6.5 - 7.5
   - TDS: < 100 ppm
   - COD: < 10 ppm
   - BOD: < 5 ppm
   *Recycled water to be used for Cooling Tower makeup and Floor Washing.*

4. Sludge Management:
   - ME Sludge (Solid): Bagged and stored in Haz Waste Shed.
   - Disposal: Sent to TSDF (Ramky Enviro Engineers).
