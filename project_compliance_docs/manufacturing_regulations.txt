3. AIR POLLUTION CONTROL
(PCB Standards 1.2)

Manufacturing units generating air emissions must install Air Pollution Control Devices (APCDs).

3.1 Stack Height Requirements

Minimum stack height: 30 meters

H = 14(Q)^0.3, where Q = SO₂ emission rate (kg/hr)

The higher value shall apply

3.2 Approved APCDs

Bag Filters – dust-generating units

Electrostatic Precipitators (ESP) – boilers > 2 TPH

Wet Scrubbers – chemical processes

Required Documents:

8. DOCUMENTATION CHECKLIST FOR APPROVAL

Applicants must prepare the following before visiting local authorities:

Site Plan with dimensions and surroundings

Consent to Establish (PCB)

Factory License Plan

ZLD Technical Report

Detailed Project Report (DPR)

Fire Safety Declaration / NOC

Hazardous Waste Declaration

On-site Emergency Plan (if applicable)

9. NON-COMPLIANCE CONSEQUENCES
