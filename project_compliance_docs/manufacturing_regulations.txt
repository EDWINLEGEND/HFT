## 1. POLLUTION CONTROL BOARD (PCB) STANDARDS
### 1.1 Water Pollution Control (Zero Liquid Discharge)
All manufacturing units classified under the "Red" and "Orange" categories must implement a Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) system.
- **Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP):** Mandatory for units discharging > 10 KLD of trade effluent.
- **Treated Water Quality:**
  - pH: 6.5 - 8.5
  - BOD (3 days at 27°C): < 30 mg/l
  - COD: < 250 mg/l
  - TSS: < 100 mg/l
  - Oil & Grease: < 10 mg/l

### 1.2 Air Pollution Control
Units contributing to particulate matter emissions must install appropriate Air Pollution Control Devices (APCD) such as:
- Electrostatic Precipitators (ESP) for boilers > 2 TPH.
- Bag Filters for cement/dust generating units.
- Stack Height: Minimum H = 14(Q)^0.3 where Q is SO2 emission rate in kg/hr, or strictly 30m whichever is higher.

## 2. HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT
### 2.1 Storage and Labeling
- Designated storage area must be impervious and covered.
- Containers must be labeled with "HAZARDOUS WASTE" in fluorescent yellow background with red letters.
- Maximum storage period: 90 days.

### 2.2 Disposal

- Manifest system (Form 10) must be maintained for every consignment.

## 3. INDUSTRIAL SAFETY & HEALTH
### 3.1 Factory Act Compliance
- **Ventilation:** Adequate air changes per hour (minimum 6 ACPH) in work halls.
- **Lighting:** Minimum 500 Lux in production areas.
- **Exits:** Minimum two distinct exits for every floor/room > 500 sq.ft.
- **Fire Safety:**
  - Hydrant system mandatory for built-up area > 500 sq.m.
  - Automatic Sprinklers required in high-hazard zones (e.g., chemical storage).

## 4. LABOR WELFARE
- **Rest Rooms:** Mandatory if > 150 workers.
- **Crèche:** Mandatory if > 30 women workers.
- **Drinking Water:** 1 point for every 50 workers, located at least 6m away from toilets.

## 5. DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS FOR APPROVAL
1. **Consent to Establish (CTE):** From State Pollution Control Board.
2. **Factory License:** From Department of Factories & Boilers.
3. **Fire NOC:** From Fire & Emergency Services.
4. **Detailed Project Report (DPR):** Including process flow, chemical mass balance, and water balance chart.
5. **On-site Emergency Plan:** For handling hazardous chemical leaks.
