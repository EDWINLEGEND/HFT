WATER POLLUTION CONTROL RULES 2024
(Applicable to Chemical & Industrial Processing Units)

CHAPTER 1: PRELIMINARY

1. Short Title and Commencement
   (1) These rules may be called the Water Pollution Control (Chemical Industries) Rules, 2024.
   (2) They shall come into force on the date of their publication in the Official Gazette.

2. Application
   These rules apply to all industrial units engaged in chemical processing, pharmaceutical manufacturing, dye production, and heavy metal processing.

CHAPTER 2: EFFLUENT DISCHARGE STANDARDS

3. Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD)
   (1) All "Red Category" chemical industries, including those processing hazardous chemicals, dyes, or heavy metals, MUST implement a Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) system.
   (2) The discharge of treated or untreated effluent into any water body, river, stream, or public sewer is STRICTLY PROHIBITED for these industries.
   (3) All process water must be recycled and reused within the plant premises.

4. Heavy Metal Limits
   (1) For industries where ZLD is not yet mandatory (Orange/Green categories), the following limits apply for discharge into Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETP):
       (a) Lead (Pb): Max 0.1 mg/l
       (b) Mercury (Hg): Max 0.01 mg/l
       (c) Chromium (Hexavalent): Max 0.1 mg/l
       (d) Arsenic (As): Max 0.2 mg/l

5. Buffer Zones
   (1) No chemical processing unit shall be established within 500 meters of a notified river, lake, or wetland.
   (2) A green belt of at least 10 meters width must be maintained around the periphery of the industrial unit.

CHAPTER 3: STORAGE AND HANDLING

6. Chemical Storage
   (1) All hazardous chemicals must be stored in double-walled tanks with leak detection systems.
   (2) Storage areas must have impervious flooring to prevent groundwater contamination.

7. Storm Water Management
   (1) Industrial units must have a separate storm water drainage system, distinct from the effluent collection system.
   (2) First-flush rain water from the process area must be collected and treated in the Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP).

CHAPTER 4: PENALTIES

8. Violation Consequences
   (1) Any unit found discharging effluent outside premises in violation of Rule 3 (ZLD) shall be liable for immediate closure.
   (2) A fine of up to ₹50,00,000 (Fifty Lakhs) may be imposed for unauthorized dumping of chemical waste.
